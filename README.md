An attempt at recreating the Google homepage. This is my first project using HTML and CSS!

Live preview: https://yakurutu.github.io/google-homepage/

What I learned:
- how to organize files for a simple webpage (root, css, images folders)
- basic html structure and elements needed for a page to run
- adding page titles and favicons
- using flexbox to position separate groups of elements
- the difference between padding and margins!
- following style guides to keep my code, class names, and formatting consistent
- learning the differences between title and alt and ways to improve my page's accessibility
- using css pseudo-classes (:hover, :focus) to make more complex styles

I ended up spending longer than expected on this project, but it was a great learning experience and I feel a lot more confident about writing HTML and CSS. I took my time to figure out flexbox, look up different style guides, and go over multiple html tutorial videos in order to learn as much as I could, and I hope that effort is reflected in this project!
